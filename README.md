***Description***

A brief analysis of survey results for the University of Washington course: IMT 570 - Analytics Methods. The survey was designed by my team and I to analyze the perceived vs actual utility of Voice Assistants such as Google Now and Siri for individuals with non-American accents. I have performed visualizations to analyze data from the initial survey followed by regression analysis post treatment. The project has been done in Python using Pandas.
